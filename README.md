Okay, let's meet. My name is Denis, now I am 21 years old. I am finishing my master's degree in biotechnology, managed to work in several biotechnology companies, and realized that this is not exactly mine ...
For more than a year, I thought about trying to write code (once I installed Linux, and interest in the industry began to emerge on its own), but I put it off. Maybe someone knows what it's like when you don't finish everything, fall into laziness and freeze?
The day before yesterday I managed to finish one very little thing - I finished the introductory course in statistics and R (before that I took python courses, but it didn't have a strong impact on me), and the direct inspiration came as well.
During the day I finished the week CS50, 2 typing lessons, began to learn English (which, incidentally, I speak very poorly (somewhere at the A2 level), so the translations of my tweets - just an edited machine translation)
